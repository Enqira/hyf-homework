Buddy's Bolognese

Place a large shallow casserole pan on a medium-high heat. 
Squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins.
Put 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the pan, with the mince and sausagemeat, breaking everything up with a wooden spoon. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly, while you prep your vegetables.
Peel the onions and garlic, trim the carrots, celery and courgette. Coarsely grate all the veg on a box grater, finely grate the garlic, and stir it all into the pan.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and sweet, stirring occasionally.
Add the balsamic vinegar and the tinned tomatoes. Half fill each tin with water, swirl it around to pick up all the last bits of tomato and pour into the pan.
Stir in the tomato purée and a pinch of black pepper. Mash everything up with your spoon, reduce to low and leave to cook for 2 to 3 hours, or until thick, glossy and reduced.
About 15 minutes before you’re ready to serve, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water.
Add the pasta to the sauce, stir in some of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce stick and mix well over the heat.
Use tongs to divide between your bowls, then serve with a good grating of Parmesan cheese.
