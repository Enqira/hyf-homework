​Pissaladiere (anchovy, onion and olive tart)

A classic dish straight out of Nice in the South of France, pissaladiere is a punchy umami-laden "tart". Traditionally the base was made with bread dough, but I like to use pastry. Good for a light lunch, snack or entree; just add spring sunshine and a glass of wine.
